_Primary Components:_

- [WelcomeHeader] - Your opening gambit. Project title, brief description, maybe a subtle animation to establish dominance over competing chat interfaces.

- [ModeSelector] - The philosophical choice between "Tutor" and "Assistant" modes. Radio buttons, toggle switches, or cards with clear descriptions of what each mode entails. Tutor mode presumably holds their hand through concepts; Assistant mode assumes they know what they're doing (dangerous assumption, but we'll allow it).

- [ProficiencySelector] - This is where users confess their actual capabilities. Slider, dropdown, or progressive disclosure with options like "Beginner," "Intermediate," "Advanced," or "I wrote the documentation." Include brief descriptions so they can't claim ignorance later.

- [TopicSelector] - Let users choose their domain of interest - programming languages or natural languages.

_Supporting Elements:_

- [OnboardingCards] - Brief explanations of what each mode and proficiency level actually means. Prevent users from selecting "Advanced" when they clearly need "Please explain what a variable is."

- [PreferencesPanel] - Optional settings for chat behavior, response length, formality level. For the control enthusiasts.

- [StartChatButton] - The point of no return. Possibly disabled until all required selections are made, because we're methodical like that.

- [WelcomeCard] - Main card cointaining the options for the user to choose/write.
