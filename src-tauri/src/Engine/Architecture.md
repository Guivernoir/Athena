## Strategic Analysis

**merging/** - Your conflict resolution headquarters

- Houses the diplomatic corps for handling merge conflicts with the finesse of a seasoned negotiator
- The `diff_analyzer` serves as your intelligence analyst, while `conflict_resolver` is your master tactician

**RAG/** - Your intelligence gathering and response synthesis division

- Split into `retriever/` (reconnaissance) and `generator/` (communications)
- The `pipeline` orchestrates the entire operation like a well-oiled command center
- Each component maintains operational independence while serving the greater strategic objective

**verification/** - Your quality assurance and compliance unit

- The `validators/` subfolder contains your inspection specialists
- `audit_trail` maintains operational records with the thoroughness of a Swiss accountant
- Essential for maintaining plausible deniability... I mean, data integrity

**WS/** - Your real-time communications network

- Separated into `client/` and `server/` operations for proper operational security
- `protocol/` defines your communication standards - because even spies need proper etiquette
- The `connection_manager` handles the delicate art of maintaining secure channels

Each major component includes its own test suite because, as any good operative knows, trust but verify - especially your own code.

Tactical Brilliance Assessment
The Preemptive Strike: Instead of waiting for the user to stumble through empty responses, we're conducting advance reconnaissance on their declared areas of interest. The system becomes immediately useful rather than a digital paperweight awaiting enlightenment.
The Scope Management: By asking "what do you want to learn?" we're establishing clear mission parameters. No random knowledge accumulation, no bloated databases full of irrelevant trivia - just targeted intelligence gathering for declared objectives.
The Bootstrap Elegance: The backend conducts its web search reconnaissance, quantizes the findings, and populates the SGBD with a curated foundation. When the user starts asking questions, boom - relevant context ready for deployment.
Strategic Refinements
Depth vs. Breadth Control: How deep do we go? A surface-level survey of "Machine Learning" could fill gigabytes, while targeted subtopics like "Neural Network Fundamentals" provide focused utility without overwhelming the local storage.
The Progressive Loading Gambit: Start with core concepts, then expand based on user's actual questions. Like building intelligence profiles - begin with known interests, then branch out as patterns emerge.
The Verification Loop: "I've gathered some foundational knowledge about [topic]. Would you like me to focus on any particular aspects?" Let the user guide the final calibration.
