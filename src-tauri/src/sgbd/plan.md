# ========================== types.rs =================================

Here's a concise summary of the types.rs file components:

1.  Error Handling

    SGBDError Enum: Comprehensive error taxonomy with variants:

        I/O, Serialization, Index, KeyNotFound, Transaction

        Quantization, WAL, Schema, Constraint, Concurrency, ResourceExhausted

        Includes contextual data and optional backtraces

    Error Utilities: with_backtrace() and backtrace() methods

2.  Serialization

    SerializationFormat Enum: Bincode, MessagePack, JSON, Custom, Runtime

    SerializationStrategy Trait: Pluggable serialization/deserialization

    Implementations: BincodeStrategy, JsonStrategy, MessagePackStrategy

    Error Conversions: From std::io::Error, serde_json::Error, bincode::Error

3.  Core Data Structures
    Keys

        Key Struct: Composite key with:

            id (UUID, Numeric, Composite, or Custom Bytes)

            timestamp (nanosecond precision)

            schema_version, tenant_id

        Utilities: Sharding, serialization, ordering, display formatting

Values

    Value Enum:

        InputRecord, Metadata, Raw Bytes, Structured, TimeSeries, Blob

        Compression-aware serialization

    InputRecord: Raw I/O, parsed data, quantized data, metadata, relationships

    CompressedData: Zero-copy storage with compression metrics

4.  Metadata & Relationships

    RecordMetadata: Temporal info, size metrics, quality scores, lineage

    Relationship: Typed connections between records with strength scores

    AttributeValue: Typed custom attributes (String, Number, Bytes, etc.)

5.  Transactions

    TransactionContext:

        Isolation levels, timestamps, lock management, savepoints

    LockInfo: Key-specific locks with types (Shared/Exclusive)

    Savepoint: WAL position tracking

6.  Query Execution

    QueryContext:

        Timeouts, memory limits, execution plans

    QueryMetrics: Performance counters (cache hits, rows examined)

7.  Configuration

    DatabaseConfig:

        Storage backends (LocalFS, ObjectStore, Distributed)

        WAL settings, compression, indexing, transactions

        Cloud deployment support

    Presets: development(), production(), cloud()

8.  System Monitoring

    SystemMetrics:

        Storage/Memory utilization, latency percentiles

        Transaction stats, error rates, replication lag

    Health Checks: is_healthy(), needs_compaction()

9.  Indexing

    IndexMetadata:

        BTree, Hash, Bitmap, Vector, Geospatial types

        Field specifications and statistics

    IndexConfiguration: Cache policies, compression, bloom filters

10. Batch Operations

    BatchOperation:

        Atomic, BestEffort, or Parallel execution modes

    Operation Enum: Insert/Update/Delete/Upsert with conditional variants

    BatchResult: Success metrics and failure diagnostics

11. Utilities

    Timestamps: Nanosecond precision with conversions

    Zero-Copy Patterns: Extensive use of Bytes for efficiency

    Hashing/Ordering: Custom implementations for Key

    Validation: Schema rules, checksums, quality thresholds

Key Technical Themes

    Performance-Centric Design:

        Zero-copy operations (Bytes everywhere)

        Compression-aware serialization

        Pluggable storage backends

    Robust Error Handling:

        Context-rich errors with backtraces

        Comprehensive error taxonomy

    Operational Flexibility:

        Runtime-configurable serialization/compression

        Cloud-native deployment support

        Extensive metrics collection

    ACID Compliance:

        Transaction isolation levels

        Lock management

        WAL integration

    Advanced Data Modeling:

        Temporal keys

        Relationship graphs

        Polymorphic value types

This file defines the foundational types for a high-performance, operationally flexible database system with strong ACID guarantees and cloud-native capabilities.
